  Information about this software is included in the README file.

  This program is licensed under the GNU General Public License. See the 
  COPYING file for more information.

Installing MacAceUpdater
------------------------
MacAceUpdater is distributed in binary form inside a Mac OS X disk image (.dmg)
file. This is almost certainly what you have, and need. In this case, to 
install the software, simply load the disk image and drag the application from
the disk image folder onto your Mac somewhere (such as /Applications), and
double click the copied application to run it. You do not need to compile the
software yourself.


Compiling MacAceUpdater
-----------------------
You almost certainly don't need to compile this software yourself, as it is
distributed pre-compiled. If, however, you wish to compile it yourself for
some reason, the software depends upon the following frameworks:

/Library/Frameworks/Growl.framework (http://growl.info)
/Library/Frameworks/Sparkle.framework (http://andymatuschak.org/pages/sparkle)

If you have these frameworks, simply load MacAceUpdater.xcodeproj and press 
'build'. Ensure that you have zerolink disabled - both in the build menu and
in the project properties, and that you have both ppc and i386 binary types
enabled.

If you wish to create a disk image of your build, edit the dmg/Makefile file
as appropriate, and then, in a terminal window, cd to dmg/ and run `make`.
