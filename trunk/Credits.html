Please report bugs / feature requests to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macaceupdater/issues/list">Issue Tracker</a><br />
Some people have expressed interest in donating to me for the application; this is far from compulsory but is, of course, greatly appreciated. <br />
If you wish to donate something, there are a couple of options - if you'd like to send some real-world cash, there's a donation button at <a href="http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/software/macaceupdater/">http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/software/macaceupdater/</a>.<br />
Alternatively, my character (Katail, on Turalyon Europe) is always broke and would appreciate any spare gold.<br />
Or I'd just be glad to hear you use MAU and find it useful :)<br />
