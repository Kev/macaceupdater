This is a list of things that need to be done before a release.

= Code =
  * Update numbers in Info.plist.
  * Update README.
  * Check [http://code.google.com/p/macaceupdater/issues/list Issue tracker] for remaining issues.
  * Enable Release mode.

= Packaging = 
  * At the moment simply a tarball - I need to do something about DMGs.

= Announcement =
  * At the moment I'm not announcing anywhere - I should probably change this.
