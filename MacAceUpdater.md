# Introduction #
> MacAceUpdater (MAU) is a native Mac OS X implementation using Objective-C and Cocoa of a program somewhat like the popular WoWAceUpdater (formerly WinAceUpdater).

> It was started on the 24th December 2006 as a good excuse for me to learn Objective-C and Cocoa (and notably not because I thought there was anything wrong with the other tools available at the time). It is not intended at the moment for public use, although I'd be glad if someone somewhere benefited from it in some way. At the moment it's held together by too much string and tape, but one day maybe someone (even me) will clean it up and it'll be useful.

Enjoy
