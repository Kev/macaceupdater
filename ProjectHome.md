## Notice ##
I currently do not have time to maintain MacAceUpdater. If you're interested in maintaining the application, please let me know.

## MacAceUpdater ##
MacAceUpdater is an implementation for OSX in Objective-C and Cocoa of an Ace mod manager for World of Warcraft, similar to WowAceUpdater (formerly WinAceUpdater), written by Kevin Smith.

It currently requires OS X 10.4 and `/usr/bin/unzip` (you will almost certainly have the latter if in doubt).

Any problems or feature requests, please report them.

Some people like MacAceUpdater so much they've asked for a way to make donations to show their support for the app. Unfortunately, I don't know how to add a donation button to the Google Code wiki, but I've instead added one to the page at: http://www.kismith.co.uk/wordpress/index.php/software/macaceupdater
If you feel MAU makes a difference to you, please consider donating (and also to the Ace project for making the addons themselves available!).
