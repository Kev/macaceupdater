About
-----
  MacAceUpdater is a native Mac OS X implementation using Objective-C and 
  Cocoa of a program somewhat like the popular WoWAceUpdater (formerly 
  WinAceUpdater). 

  It was started on the 24th December 2006 as a good excuse for me to learn
  Objective-C and Cocoa (and notably not because I thought there was anything
  wrong with the other tools available at the time). It is not intended at
  the moment for public use, although I'd be glad if someone somewhere 
  benefited from it in some way. At the moment it's held together by too much
  string and tape, but one day maybe someone (even me) will clean it up and
  it'll be useful.

Known Issues
------------
  The following are known issues or bugs with this release.
  - The wow folder path is hard coded.
  - It depends upon /usr/bin/unzip for mod extraction.
  - The search widget doesn't work.
  - The init button must be clicked before it'll do anything useful.
  - It may destroy your pet dinosaur and if it does, you get to keep
    the pieces.
Notes
-----
  This is an early release of a private project - it is entirely possible 
  and even likely that things will go wrong in ways I haven't even imagined.
  Do not deploy on critical systems, whatever that means to you, and make
  sure you have recent backups, especially of your AddOns directory.
