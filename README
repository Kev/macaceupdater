About
-----
  MacAceUpdater is a native Mac OS X implementation using Objective-C and 
  Cocoa of a program somewhat like the popular WoWAceUpdater (formerly 
  WinAceUpdater). 

  The project is currently hosted at http://code.google.com/p/macaceupdater
  bugs can currently be reported, or features requested in the issue tracker
  there.
  
  It was started on the 24th December 2006 as a good excuse for me to learn
  Objective-C and Cocoa (and notably not because I thought there was anything
  wrong with the other tools available at the time). It was not originally
  intended for public use, but it has since grown beyond my expectations, and
  I'd be glad if someone somewhere benefited from it in some way. Initially, 
  it was held together by too much string and tape, but I'm gradually going
  through to clean it up and it should be in a state where it's generally 
  useful.

Known Issues
------------
  The following are known issues or bugs with this release.
  - It depends upon /usr/bin/unzip for mod extraction.
  - It may destroy your pet dinosaur and if it does, you get to keep
    the pieces.

Notes
-----
  This is an early release of a private project - it is entirely possible 
  and even likely that things will go wrong in ways I haven't even imagined.
  Do not deploy on critical systems, whatever that means to you, and make
  sure you have recent backups, especially of your AddOns directory.
